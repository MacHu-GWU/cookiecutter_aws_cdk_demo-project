"""
The top-level configuration model.

:class:`Config` holds every project-level setting the stacks and scripts need.
Resource names are not written here but derived in ``config_01_name.py``.

To add a group of related settings, put them in a new numbered module
(``config_01_xxx.py``, ``config_02_xxx.py``, ...) as a mixin or a nested model,
then add it to :class:`Config` here. The number gives the reading order: lower
modules are more foundational.

**Where the values come from:** ``config/*.json5`` files at the repo root, read by
:meth:`Config.load_from_local_config_file`. This is an infrastructure project, so the
project admin deploys from a local machine, and :meth:`Config.load` supports no other
runtime on purpose.
